# Icons for PothosGui

This directory contains the complete icon set used by the PothosGui.
The names of the icons come directly from the freedesktop icon naming specification.
The codebase will try to use an icon from an installed freedesktop icon theme.
Otherwise, the codebase will use an icon from this fallback icon set
if the icon is not present or this is an OS without freedesktop icon themes,

Most of these icons are copied from: /usr/share/icons/oxygen/48x48/actions/* (Ubuntu 14.04).
However, a few of the stock icons have been customized for appearance.
And several new icons have been created specifically for this application.
